Another classic, but this one is interesting for all the wrong reasons.

I didn't find the story very exciting or valuable in itself. The words are archaic, sentences are overly nested and complicated, and, terrifyingly, there are no chapters whatsoever. The strength of this edition lies in the introduction and editor's notes. The notes come together to about a third of the volume and explain anything that wasn't clear yet. They turn an average story into a time machine that let me discover the customs and goals of people in the 1700s, from their ideas on slavery through language to fiction in literature.

If you can cope with the terrible speed of reading this book imposes, it's going to teach you some history.
