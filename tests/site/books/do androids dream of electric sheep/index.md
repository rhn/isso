I wanted to read this book since I watched Blade Runner, expecting some explanations that would finally let me understand the movie.

No understanding was gained.

The book is kind of on the same topic, it's grimy, it's about androids, but it told me some very different stories. It was less about a tough hunter and more about many confused people, and I'm one of them. I see a pattern in Dick's books - things are not what they seem to be, but I'm not the one to know what they *really* are.

It's a nourishing reading, but I couldn't help feeling unsatisfied after finishing it.
