Jane Austen's acclaimed classic, Penguin edition. People say it's important because of the novel way to use language.

For me, it was an interesting foray into the Victorian world and strange customs. Anything close to "dear mister husband" sounds weird in the beginning, but after a while it becomes normal. Maybe it's not the easiest book to read, but very rewarding if you care about old school manners.

This is the first actual book in the library!
