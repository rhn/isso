What's Marginalia?
==================

*Marginalia* is a book exchange with a twist.

Sharing
-------

Sharing books is fun, right? It lets your ideas spread, and makes other people happy. But lending them out to friends has its problems. What if we forget who has the book now? What if someone forgets it was borrowed? What if we have so many books that they *take over and kick us out*?

It would be nice to have people report back when they finish the book, wouldn't it? But it's not fun, so no one would do it :(

The Twist
---------

My book is an adventurer! It travels around the world and writes a journal, telling everyone how it changed readers' views, and maybe even lives!

*Marginalia* is a place where books share their adventures through their readers.

Who's behind it?
----------------

Marginalia was born in the head of [*The Librarian*](mailto:librarian__at__porcupinefactory__dot__org) in 2017. 

It was a way to empty mouldering shelves and spread the amazing liberated books.

So far, it's been done entirely in Librarian's free time.

Thanks to my friends for encouraging me!

What's the problem with other book exchanges?
---------------------------------------------

There's a lot of book exchange projects, but the good books could end up stuck on someone's shelf and only mediocre onres would be left. Maybe we could make sharing more fun than keeping, by watching where the books go?

Why bother?
-----------

Because it sounds like a cool thing to do!
