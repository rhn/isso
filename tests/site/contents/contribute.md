Books

Do you want to set your book on an adventure? We can give it a journal. Genre, form, audience don't matter. If the book is valuable, it has a place in Marginalia.

There are three requirements: it must be made of paper, you must own it, and it must be in English (sorry, the site is not translated yet :( )

* * *

To register a book in the library, drop a short email to [this address (remove the underscores)](mailto:librarian_at_porcupinefactory_dot_org). In the email:

- give us a reason to share it: how is it valuable? Did it turn your life around? Made it into pop culture? Showed you medieval times? Made you laugh? Helped you pass the exam? Taught you calculus?
- show a picture of the front cover
- show a picture of the publication date/edition/translation
- say how big it is (in cm), to make a correctly sized bookplate
- say if you want your name in the description

Feel free to send pictures of interesting elements, or mention the state of the book - they will be useful on the webpage.

Or skip it all and just say hi :)

In return, you will get a [bookplate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookplate) as PDF, to attach to the back cover, and a link to the new book's page, where you can write the first journal entry.
