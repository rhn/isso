Book codes
==========

Did you come across a book with a sticker on the back cover? Does the sticker mention *Marginalia* and contain a mysterious *Book Code*?

**Congratulations! A book with a jornal visited you!**

Now you hold the pen: it's the *Book Code*. Just enter it into the box and write.

But wait, what is this journal?
-------------------------------

All *Marginalia*'s books [have one](/library/). That's because they are travelers. They want to collect stories from all over the world and write about them.

What should I write?
--------------------

Tell everyone what made this book unique. Did you take it to the top of the mountain? Did someone's dog eat it? Did it help you understand love? Was it super boring? Did your mum like it? Who do you want to give it next?

We're eager to know!

I wrote in the journal! What next?
----------------------------------

Save the *Book Code* and comment on other entries if you like.

And don't forget to give the book to the next person! A book with no readers is a very sad book.

I don't want to write anything.
-------------------------------

That's fine. You can ignore the journal entirely â€” but please, give the book to someone new after you stop reading it.
