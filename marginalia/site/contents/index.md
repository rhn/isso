# Marginalia

A library in which paper books are free to travel.

## Manifesto

Books are not meant to gather dust on shelves! They are meant to change hands and be read by people! Marginalia wants to give great books another life by taking them from hidden shelves, giving them back to people and looking at paths they take.

## Books

We're trying to keep the bar high and share valuable ones.

Do you want your book to travel too? Tell us and we can [give it a journal](/contribute/).

## Book Codes
