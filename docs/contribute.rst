Write some code.
----------------

I appreciate any help and love pull requests. Here are some things you
need to respect:

*  Marginalia is a very focused project, for practical reasons. Removing is more welcome than adding.
*  no hard-wired external services (e.g. Gravatar, Akismet)
*  no support for ancient browsers (e.g. IE6-9)

Report issues
-------------

- **embed.min.js-related issues** –  if you get a cryptic JavaScript error in
  the console, embed ``embed.dev.js`` instead of ``embed.min.js`` and create an
  issue with ±10 lines of code around the error.

- **Isso-related issues** – Copy and paste traceback into a ticket and provide
  some details of your usage.

Where I need help
-----------------

- Faster and simpler JS version
- Server-generated version (using API)
- Native application (using the API again)
- Moar books!
